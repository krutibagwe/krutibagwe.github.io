<h3><font color="green">Overview</font></h3>
I am a third year engineering student currently pursuing Bachelor's in Information Technology from Mumbai University.
My technical skills include languages like Python, C++, C, Java, SQL, Kotlin, HTML and CSS. 
I am interested in Machine Learning and have hands-on experience with Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib.
I'm intrigued by the potential of data and machine learning to solve real-world problems and I'm eager to
explore innovative applications in this field.
I am actively looking for software development/Machine Leaning internships.

<h3><font color="green">Projects</font></h3>
Here are some selected projects that can be found on my Github (<a href="https://github.com/krutibagwe">link to Github profile</a>):
	  <ul>
		
		<li><a href="https://github.com/krutibagwe/digit-classification-tf">Handwritten Digit Classification Model</a> : A handwritting classification model built
		using Tensorflow and Keras with an accuracy of 97%. The MNST dataset is used to train the model
		Other libraries used are NumPy and MatPlotLib. It is a simple project to demonstrate use of 
		Neural Networks.
		</li>
		<li><a href= "https://github.com/krutibagwe/quiz_attendance_tracker">Automated Attendance Tracking System</a> : An attendance tracking system which automatically marks attendance
		on the basis of quiz scores. The application includes featuers like adding new teachers & students, adding new questions, hosting and attempting quizzes, view progress 
		and attendance. Data visualization concepts such as graphs, pie charts, etc are used to represent marks and attendance and to better understand the progress.
		It is built using Python, Tkinter & CustomTkinter (for GUI), Numpy & Matplotlib (for data visualisation), MySQL (for database management).
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/krutibagwe/hotel-management-system">Hotel Management System</a> : A desktop application to manage hotels
		by keeping track of vacant rooms, store information about employees, additional filters for searching rooms, 
		check-in/check-out, payment balance calculation and more. 
		It is written using Java (Swing and AWT for GUI) and MySQL for database management.
		</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/krutibagwe/book-progress-tracker">Book Reading Progress Tracker</a> : A web application to keep track books being read.
		It has additional featuers to mark books as favourite and display favourite as well as completed books.
		It is build using HTML, CSS & JavaScript and the framework used is Flask.
		</li>
